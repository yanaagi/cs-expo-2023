        "abstract": "Accurately matching the shade of dental composite restorations to  natural teeth is a crucial aspect of dental treatment, as it can  significantly impact patient satisfaction and treatment outcomes.  However, the subjective nature of manual shade selection often  leads to shade mismatch, with reports suggesting that  approximately 35% of composite restorations fail on the first visit.  To address this problem, this study proposes a novel approach that  utilizes image processing and deep learning techniques for  objective and consistent dental shade matching. The developed  system employs Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based  MediaPipe Facial Landmark Detection and Support Vector  Machines (SVMs) for objective and consistent dental shade  matching. The system achieved an estimated accuracy of 90%  compared to traditional manual shade matching. The system has  scored an overall average of 4.58 on an initial survey using the ISO  25010 guidelines and 4.64 on a subsequent resurvey, indicating its  high agreeability and satisfiability in achieving objective and  consistent dental shade matching. The implementation and  validation of this application offer a significant technological  advancement in dental shade matching, reducing the likelihood of  shade mismatch. The findings have significant implications for  clinical practice, empowering dental professionals with a reliable  tool to improve patient care and satisfaction.

The main goal of the study is to provide a unique method for reducing kitchen food waste using a recommendation system and image processing-driven food analysis. For the image processing-driven food analysis, the researchers employed the YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once version 5) model, a state-of-the-art deep learning model renowned for its real-time object detection capabilities. YOLOv5 enables the system to accurately identify and classify various food items within images, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of food waste patterns. Simultaneously, a content-based recommendation system was implemented using cosine similarity. This recommendation system analyzes the ingredients of food items detected by the YOLOv5 model and compares them to suggest recipes that utilize similar ingredients. Cosine similarity, a mathematical measure of similarity between two vectors, is applied to determine the likeness between ingredient profiles. This innovative approach enhances the system's ability to suggest relevant recipes that align with the available ingredients in a user's kitchen. The importance of this study rests in its creative strategy for addressing the pressing problem of food waste. The \"GoGreen\" technology provides a workable approach to lowering kitchen waste by smoothly merging image processing for food analysis and a well-structured suggestion system. The results of this study offer useful information for both homes and culinary experts as food waste continues to pose ethical and environmental problems.",

        "abstract": "The thesis involved the usage of the Backtracking Algorithm and Yolov5 to create a phishing and spam email detector. The researchers picked 55 respondents, ranging from Information  Technology and Computer Science students, professors,  professionals, normal Gmail users, and workers under the age of  60. After testing the system, the respondents answered a five-to ten-minute survey regarding the performance of the system. Based  on the results of said survey, 64.2% of the respondents agreed that  the system successfully detected phishing and spam emails as well  as determining legitimate emails. Respondents’ comments include  praising the scoring system as well as color-coding the email  based on its severity so that the user may easily identify which  was a phishing or spam email. There were also suggestions such  as making the interface more colorful as well as having its results  screen a refresh button to avoid going back to the dashboard and  scanning once more. Given the results of the survey, the system  was a near-perfect success, despite the minor errors and  suggestions given. Future researchers would use this to expand the  current application and improve its performance by adding a  budget to its development as this application had no budget.  Future researchers were also recommended to expand the  system’s availability in operating systems, such as being able to  be run in MacOS and(or) Linux, as well as being able to accept  other types of online accounts such as Outlook.",

        "abstract": "Online education has gained widespread popularity due to its delivery of high-quality educational content, rich visual resources, and access to expert instructors. However, maintaining student engagement and comprehension in online classes remains a challenge. In response, we introduce a software that analyzes educational videos, designed to enhance students' understanding of these videos efficiently. We present Video Lens, a web application that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision techniques, rooted in deep learning foundation models. It has four video analysis features: searching in video, transcription, summarization, and topic detection.\nWe have found in the evaluation, involving students and teaching staff, the potential for Video Lens as a valuable educational tool. As a result, Video Lens has allowed us to let students test a tool for those who would like to efficiently use their time and efforts in studying their courses accompanied by video materials. This efficiency allows teaching staff to allocate more time to prepare and understand the content of lecture videos beforehand. These findings emphasize its potential to enhance the learning experience when engaging with lecture videos.",

        "abstract": "Video games have been around for a long time and have become a big part of people’s lives. The number of people that enjoy them are numerous; however, not everyone who enjoys them can actually play them due to physical limitations. This study aims to help people with disabilities, specifically those on the arms or hands, by providing them a new way to play games, specifically computer games, through the use of face detection, face recognition, and a face and head movement tracking system to control the video game. The program is made to be utilized in playing only simple games with at most seven controls, and can only input at maximum, two controls simultaneously. Special focus was given in making the program lightweight in order to be capable of real-time gameplay. The respondents for this study were sampled using the purposive sampling technique. The program was used by the respondents using computer vision and rated the program in accordance with ISO 25010. Their answers were obtained by utilizing surveys. On the other hand, the accuracy of the program was evaluated through alpha testing results utilizing the confusion matrix and real-world testing results. The results showed that the respondents strongly agree with the functional suitability, compatibility, and portability of the software, while they agree with the performance efficiency, usability, reliability, security, and maintainability of the software. Furthermore, the program yielded an average accuracy of 88% and an average F1 score of 0.86 or 86% in the alpha testing results, and an average accuracy of 89% for real world testing results. These results show that the program produced satisfactory results and can be used to play computer games hands-free.",

        "abstract": "The availability of public services to meet the needs of each community is one of the most important aspects of a country. People who require government assistance submit requests for assistance through public assistance offices, however, the number of complaints and requests received by these offices has become disproportionate to the number of people processing them. To address this, the researchers proposed the development of an automated system that can assist employees in streamlining the workflow within public assistance offices, which can help enhance workplace efficiency and quicken the resolution of cases. The system uses the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to extract relevant information from emails and classify them based on the training data, determining the appropriate agency for the email to be sent to. Emails received are initially processed and then stored in a database that can be easily edited and re-processed. During testing, the researchers conducted a trial using a testing dataset of 150 emails, which took three and a half minutes (3m30s) to classify and send emails to their appropriate agencies, which is a significant improvement compared to the manual system that is able to process 300-500 emails within a 3-day timeframe. The researchers surveyed 45 respondents comprising students, teachers, professionals, and public assistance officers to evaluate the application. The respondents rated the application an average of 4.6 out of 5.0 across the categories given by the developers which corresponds to a Satisfactory rating. For future studies, the researchers recommended for the program to accommodate more classifications, separate the nature of concern and agency in the classification, implement alternative algorithms, implement stronger security measures, and add filtering options.",

      "abstract": "According to the study of Dayao, R. J. C (2018) the Philippines faces a problem of improving Filipino students’ performance in mathematics and science. Many Filipino students lacked the capacity to academically compete globally. Geometry was one of the lowest mastered areas in grade 8 students and many were below the 75% passing mark (Capate, 2017). This shows that many students have difficulties mastering the contents of these topics. This study presents the development of a mobile application that uses an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) for grade 8 students in the topic of Geometry, specifically Triangles. The application uses the Logistic regression algorithm to predict the confusion behavior of the students by having confusion as the dependent variable and Score, TakingTime, TimePercentage, and GuessCheck constraints as the independent variables. It also uses a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) to evaluate and categorize students’ performance during quizzes. The FLC mirrors human reasoning processes to distinguish varying levels of mastery. The respondents of the study will be grade 8 students of no particular school with a sample size of 30.\nThe logistic regression model exhibited high accuracy of 95% in identifying student confusion and allows for timely intervention. Students that also took multiple attempts using the application also displayed higher scores on their subsequent quiz attempts.",
